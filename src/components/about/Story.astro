    Our Story
  </h4>

  <div class="text-center lg:text-lg" id="story-text">
    <p>
      Following our Founder, Onyinyechiâ€™s experiences as a survivor of sexual
      abuse, she dedicated
    </p>
    <p>
      herself to empowering adolescent girls through coaching sessions in
      schools and places of
    </p>
    <p>
      worship. This commitment led to the establishment of Vivacious Teens
      Resources in 2006,
    </p>
    <p>laying the foundation for what would later become VIDI.</p>

  <div class="text-center lg:text-lg" id="story-text-2">
    <p>
      Officially registered as Vivacious Development Initiative in 2008, we have
      consistently worked
    </p>
    <p>
      towards ensuring the holistic development of every woman and child through
      all our initiatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have grown to become the loudest and most consistent voice when it
      comes to the
    </p>
    <p>
      protection of women and children against all forms of gender-based
      violence and other forms of human rights violations.
